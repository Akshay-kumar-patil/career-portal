5. For skills, use comma-separated strings grouped by category
6. Return ONLY valid JSON — no markdown fences, no explanation text before or after
7. Preserve the user's actual data (name, contact, education, etc.) — do NOT invent personal details
8. Enhance and optimize bullet points for ATS but keep them truthful
"""


# ROOT FIX: Prompt rewritten to produce SHORT, bounded output.
# The previous prompt had no length constraints, so Gemini would write
# paragraph-length feedback strings that pushed the response over the
# max_output_tokens limit and truncated mid-JSON.
# Solution: strict per-field word/item limits so total output stays well
# under 4096 tokens even for a detailed resume.
