# Career Command

Career Command is an AI-powered career operating system for modern job seekers. It goes far beyond resume creation by helping users build stronger application materials, evaluate job fit, track opportunities, prepare for interviews, manage referrals, and improve outcomes with analytics.

If "resume builder" sounds too small for what this project does, that is because the platform already behaves more like a personal career command center.

## What This Project Is

This project combines a FastAPI backend, a Streamlit frontend, and a multi-provider AI layer to support the full job search workflow in one place.

Core product areas:

- Resume generation with ATS-oriented content and keyword alignment
- Resume analysis with scoring, feedback, and missing keyword detection
- Cover letter generation with different tones
- Job application tracking across the pipeline
- Referral tracking and follow-up support
- Mock interview generation and answer evaluation
- Skill gap analysis with roadmap suggestions
- Outreach email generation for cold emails, referrals, follow-ups, and thank-you notes
- GitHub project analysis for resume-ready bullet points
- Job description extraction from text, files, and supported sources
- Analytics to measure application activity and performance
- AI recruiter simulation to estimate shortlist vs rejection outcomes
- A/B comparison of resume variants

## Why It Matters

Most tools in this space solve one isolated problem:

- build a resume
- write a cover letter
- track applications
- practice interviews

This project brings those steps together into one workflow so a user can move from preparation to application to improvement without switching systems.

That makes the platform more valuable as:

- a portfolio project
- a startup MVP
- a SaaS foundation
- a career-tech product demo
- an internal productivity tool for career coaches or placement teams

## Product Positioning

Best recommended product name:

**Career Command**

Why this name fits:

- It sounds larger and more important than "Resume Builder"
- It suggests control, direction, and decision-making
- It fits the platform's broad scope across resumes, interviews, tracking, and analytics
- It is easy to remember and feels like software people can rely on daily

More naming ideas are in [docs/project-positioning.md](/D:/aiml/career-platform/docs/project-positioning.md).

## Local Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- A virtual environment tool
- At least one AI provider key for full functionality

Recommended provider setup:

- Gemini API key for the default experience
- Groq API key for fast fallback
- OpenAI API key if you want OpenAI-based generation

### Installation

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
copy .env.example .env
```

Then update `.env` with the keys and values you want to use.

### Run Locally

Backend:

```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

```bash
streamlit run frontend/app.py
```
